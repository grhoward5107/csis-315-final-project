        <p>When it comes to playing Kingdom Hearts III, my initial reaction was both of nostalgia and excitement for the long awaited video game. Most of the fans of this action role-playing game series, can relate to this reaction. Whereas others will initially feel overwhelmed and confused. The Kingdom Hearts series is not for the faint of heart but if you stick with it then there may be a reward for you around the corner.</p>
        
        <p>To discover this reward, you and I will have to recap the story, explore the combat system, and find out where the video game succeeded and where it failed. As a video gamer who has played most of the Kingdom Hearts video games, Kingdom Hearts 3 is a great video game but not a perfect video game. It has successes and failures but it also has a lot of heart when it comes to the main story and the characters that drive the story. The story begins with the main character of the franchise, a teenager named Sora. Sora lost his skills and powers that he achieved through the previous video games. The reason that he lost them is because he fell to the darkness in a previous video game called Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance, but that is a discussion for another day. Unlike the previous installments, Sora does not face just Disney villains and/or the Heartless, he faces an old man named Master Xehanort.</p>
        
        <p>Master Xehanort stole Sora's skills and powers from the previous games by making different versions of himself throughout time to meet at a particular point in the present time. In the present time, he steal the protagonist's skills and powers and start a war with his friends over a weapon. The weapon is known as the X-blade and it can unlock the door to all Disney and Final Fantasy worlds called Kingdom Hearts. At the same time, Sora needs to save three of Mickey's friends who are lost to the darkness which can be explained another time. However, without his skills and powers, Mickey and his best friend, Riku, take on this particular mission because Mickey and Riku are masters of the main franchise's weapon called the Keyblade. Sora's skills and powers are known as the "Power of Waking". It is a power that Sora uses to awaken people from deep slumber and to unlock hearts back into present day.</p>
        
        <p>In order to reclaim the "Power of Waking", Sora travels to the Disney worlds of Hercules, Tangled, Frozen, Pirates of the Caribbean, Winnie the Pooh and Big Hero 6. He also travels to the Disney and Pixar worlds of Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. to learn from the main characters of these particular Disney movies how to reclaim his lost power. In the meantime, the supporting characters are either training for the war ahead or are searching for the lost friends of Mickey. In my personal opinion, the main story's execution is inconsistent. The problem of this video game's story is the main plot. Through the supporting characters of Kingdom Hearts III, two subplots take away from the main plot of the main story conceptually.</p>
            
        <p>Another thing to note is the consistency of the execution of the main story from the start of the game to the end of the game. At the beginning of the game, the execution is done well within the first Disney world. However, after all the Disney worlds are visited and the non-Disney worlds are being explored, the main story feels rushed by saving too many things towards the end of the game and not spacing things out for the audience to breathe as the game reaches towards its climax. If I was a newcomer to the Kingdom Hearts series then I would be lost because the creator of the video game relies heavily on previous entries of the Kingdom Hearts series to tie things together. Overall, the score for the main story is graded as a B. Now that the story is covered, unto the combat of the video game.</p>
        
        <p>Sora fights with a gigantic key known as the Keyblade. The Keyblade is a weapon that can attack and defend the user from dark entities such as the Heartless and other villains of the story. It can also unlock Disney worlds through magical doors that leads to the Disney worlds' hearts as well as unlock people's hearts through the power discussed within the main story. Within the game, Sora can attack enemies through pressing a single button repeatedly on your video game controller to create a normal combo. With enough combos, Sora can attack enemies through various finishers. Evani1997 of ChristCenteredGamer.com explains that the finished are called "'Situation Commands', which were introduced in Birth by Sleep. By getting enough combos, Sora will unlock a finisher move that is based on the types of attacks he used to obtain it" (Kingdom Hearts III). There are other ways to attack enemies outside of just combos.</p>
        
        <p>Another thing that the creators of Kingdom Hearts 3 video game added were the ability to transform the main character's weapon. Evani1997 calls these transformations, "Keyblade transformations" (evani1997). Although the Keyblade is the only weapon in the game, Sora can change the weapon's abilities by changing the Keyblade's type to a Disney and/or Pixar themed world type. The Keyblade can transform into "a shield, a hammer, a drill, and dual pistols. Not all of them are as fun as they sound, but they still present a good amount of variety" (evani1997). This allows the protagonist to attack the antagonists of this video game in varoius ways.</p>
        
        <p>The final observation of Kingdom Hearts 3's combat is the usage of attraction flow. Evani1997 calls the execution of attraction flow as "a number of attacks based on various Disney theme park attractions. Though the attacks can be very effective at times, they tend to slow the pace down a bit too much for my liking" (evani1997). Unlike the main story, the combo is executed well and is simple enough for newcomers of the video game to enjoy. Overall, the score for combat is graded as an A. Now that combat is finished, next is the successes and failures of Kingdom Hearts 3.</p>
        
        <p>Kingdom Hearts 3's flaws were inconsistency in story-telling and too many characters were put into the game. As mentioned earlier, the story falters towards the end of the game because the creators of Kingdom Hearts 3 wanted to solve each plot in counting order of one, two, and three. This is a pacing issue because the audience's minds cannot stop racing towards the finish line of the game to see how it ends. Another problem is that there are way too many characters in this game. If I counted, there are at least 35 characters or more in this game and because of it some characters are sidelined. Sidelined means that the character gets very little screen time compared to other characters within a particular video game.</p>
        
        <p>Kingdom Hearts 3 was successful in fulfilling its main plot's goals and objectives. The video game ends with Mickey's friends get saved and the protagonists defeat the antagonists within the Keyblade War. Everyone has a happy ending except for the main character. Sora obtains the Power of Waking but it comes at a price due to his inexperience and over usage of the ability. The combat and the interaction with characters was also very well done by the video game designers and the voice actors that protrayed the voices. The soundtrack was also good when it came to remixing Disney classical songs and creating new songs for worlds that were not Disney and/or Pixar related. The visual graphics were the best part of Kingdom Hearts 3 with crystal clear visuals or the audience to enjoy. Overall, Kingdom Hearts 3 earn a grade of a B+ which as a video gamer grade would result in an 87. </p>
