        <h1>Changing the Role-Playing Genre</h1>
        
        <p>When it comes to the action role-playing genre of video games, most video game companies follow the genre to the nth degree. However, the creators of Cyberpunk 2077 want to take a different approach on the role-playing game's genre. Instead of the main character having medieval weapons and traveling to different worlds, the video game features the main character in his own world using modernized weapons to achieve his objectives and goals.</p>
        
        <p>Depending upon the player of this particular video game, Cyberpunk 2077 can modernized the role-playing genre for new innovations or it can fail at being an action role-playing genre game. The author hopes that through the success of modernizing the action role-playing genre that video game creators will take more risks in modernizing their video games to make combat easier to understand and for their imaginary world to become easier to navigation through. According to the creators of Cyberpunk 2077, the video game is "an open-world, action-adventure story set in the Night City, a megapolis obsessed with power, glamour, and body modification. You play as V, a mercenary outlaw going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immorality" (www.cyberpunk.net). Although the video game sounds like an interesting concept, the imaginary world and main character both appear to be based on a dark dystopian future.</p>
        
        <p>Now that Cyberpunk 2077 is known, who are the creators of the video game. According to the cyberpunk website (www.cyberpunk.net), the creators of the game are "CD Projekt Red". CD Projekt Red was "established in 2002, located in Warsaw (HQ), Krakow and Wroclaw, Poland, CD Projekt Red was born out of a raw passion for video games. The studio's founders: Michal Kicinski and Marcin Iwinski, both pioneers in video game distribution in Poland in the 90s, decided to employ their gaming industry experience in video game development" (The industry leader in creating role-playing games). Although this industry is only know for one video game franchise, there is hope for them if Cyberpunk 2077 becomes a success that they can add another video game franchise to their resume.</p>
        
        <p>There is a lot of information on this video game but the one innovation that stays out the most is the introduction of first person shooting elements in a role-playing game. According to Steven Messner, Tyler Wilde, and Lauren Morton of pcgamer.com, Cyberpunk is a first-person shooter RPG "through cutscenes and driving sometimes switches to third person, Cyberpunk 2077 involves a lot of first-person shooting. With guns. Lots of guns" (Messner, S. (2019, November 25)). In other words, there are a lot of different elements from the first-person shooter genre incorporated into this video game. Video game franchises that are a part of the first person shooter genre are the Call of Duty franchise, the Halo franchise, and the Battlefield franchise. However, as long as the video game stays true to the action role-playing genre then it can develop as many different perspectives as it wants too.</p>
        
        <p>The release of Cyberpunk 2077 is set to release on "April 16, 2020" (Messner, S. (2019, November 25). If the game is in post-production then it should release on time for video gamers to enjoy. Not only is there first person shooter elements incorporated into this role-playing game, but the video gamer can customize the main character at the beginning of the game as well. Depending upon the player's preferences, the main character known as "V" is a cyborg that can change appearances to fit the player's view of the game that he or she is currently playing. The only exception within character creation is "it doesn't look like you can change the character's bone structure though--no deep menu of facial feature sliders here" (Messner, S. (2019, November 25). The author thinks changing the bone structure of a cyborg sounds creepy and is appreciated that this is not part of the character creation process. All in all, the video game sounds like it is trying a lot of new things but the question remains how the target audience will respond to these choices and the narrative presented to them.</p>
