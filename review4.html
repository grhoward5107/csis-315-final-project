        <p>Final Fantasy X is a video game based upon the Final Fantasy series. The Final Fantasy series is a Japanese action role-playing game series that contains fifteen different stories as of 2019. Throughout the stories, the main themes that stay consists is the usage of science fiction elements while also using fantasy elements to make the stories come to live with multiple character creating a group of main characters.</p>
        
        <p>When playing Final Fantasy X, my initial reaction was of bewilderment and wonder of how good this game could really be. After playing through it entirely, I consider this video game to be a diamond in the rough when it comes to the action role-playing genre. To discover how good this gane was in the early 2000s, the video gamer needs to know the main story of Final Fantasy X, the unique combat system that the video game has to offer, and the successes and failures of the video game to the action role-playing genre. The main story is centered around a teenager named Tidus. Tidus is an orphan in his hometown of Zanarkand because his parents died a couple of years after he was born. Tidus is also known as an athlete of his hometown team called the Zanarkand Abes. The Zanarkand Abes are a fantasy sport's team that plays a fantasy underwater sport known as blitzball. Blitzball is a hybrid mixture sport of football and soccor.</p>
        
        <p>The main story of the video game changes when a ghost boy follows Tidus to the memorial sports game of Tidus's father, Jecht. While going to the sports game, Tidus reveals his memories to the audience about the relationships between his two parents. Although he is fond of his mother, he has a begrudging relationship with his father. When he enters the arena, an old man later known as Auron watches Tidus play his sports game while waiting for a catastrophe to occur to Tidus's hometown. During the catastrophe, Tidus does not know that there is wide spread panic going on about the city until after he makes the winnning goal to help his team win. After the game is over, Auron meets Tidus, gives him a weapon to learn how to fight, and the two of them fight the antagonist's subordinates to save the city. While fighting each subordinate, the duo eventually get swallowed up by one of the main antagonists of the main story and this is how the main story offically begins. </p>
            
        <p>The two main protagonists of the video game are Tidus and Yuna. Yuna is a summoner who summons monsters called aeons to help Tidus defeat the main antagonists of the story. The three main antagonists of the story are a catastrophic monster named Sin, a human and guado hybrid man named Seymour, and another catastrophic monster named Yu Yevon. Each main antagonist's role within the main story will be discussed more in depth as the story progresses. After being swallowed by the catastrophic monster named Sin, Tidus awakens in a different world called Spira within a shipwreck area of a temple called the Baaj Temple. Once fully awaken, he swims to safety from underwater monsters and camps within the interior of the temple's first floor. There he is attacked by a land monster within the temple and is saved by a group of savengers who are searching for sunken transportation vehicle within the same temple.</p>
        
        <p>Their mission is successful and Tidus becomes friends with the leader of the group named Rikku. He explains his personal and professional life to her and she thinks that he is delusional because his hometown has been destroyed for about one thousand years. Noticing that Sin has send him about one thousand years into the future, Tidus wants to return home but cannot return home due to the fact that Sin attacks him again. Separated from his new friend, he arrives at another location within the world of Spira known as the Besaid Island. Once on the shore of the island, he meets another blitzball team named the Besaid Aurochs who are known for not winning a single blitzball game and always losing. Their captain named Wakka befriends Tidus and he returns the friendship by showing the team his blitzball skills. Wakka and the team are impressed and allow him to join the team. Afterwards, Wakka takes Tidus to his hometown of Besaid within the island.</p>
        
        <p>Once Wakka and Tidus arrived, both of them hear a commotion of warnings from the townspeople about their temple. The story goes that a student summoner is trapped deep within the hometown people but only certain people are allowed to enter particular parts of the temple based upon the fantasy religion of Yevon. The relgion of Yevon follows the teachings and practices of the main antagonist of Yu Yevon. Yu Yevon is known as "a summoner who lived in Zanarkand one thousand years ago. He is Lady Yunalesca's father and the creator of Sin" (Tidus). In order for the student summoner to escape, she or he must complete the trails within the temple's chambers to obtain a type of monster called an aeon to stop Sin. Within the temple, Tidus and Wakka are introduced to two other supporting protagonists called Lulu and Kimarhi Ronso. Lulu is a female human being that knows elemental spells while Kimarhi Ronso is a feline human hybrid that uses a spear to fight in combat.</p>
        
        <p>Back to the story once again, Tidus is worried about the student summoner and wants to find out if the summoner is safe. He is about to be escorted out of the temple when the student summoner appears and tells everyone that she acquired her fisrt aeon. The student summoner is the second protagonist named Yuna. He receives a weapon from Wakka to defend himself against future enemies that they will discover on their adventure together. The adventure is a pilgrimage that Yuna needs to go on to obtain all aeons needed to defeat Sin at the end of it. However, nothing in this story goes according to plan. The next day, Tidus, Wakka, Yuna, Lulu, and Kimarhi go to another island named Kilka. On the way there, Tidus and Yuna develop a friendship based upon her relationship with Tidus's father, Jecht. She wants Tidus to be one of her guardians on her journey because his father helped her father in his pilgrimage to defeat Sin a decade before.While discussing Jecht's history between the two parties, Sin attacks Tidus and his party on the ship. They are able to preserve the ship by attacking Sin's fins and his subordinates giving the ship enough time to reach their destination. Although the ship is preserved, the island is destroyed by Sin's encounter. The protagonists help the island with their recovery as they bury the casualities and acquire another aeon from their temple. The next destination within the pilgrimage is to the city of Luca that is part of the country of Spira. Once the group arrives, Wakka and Tidus complete in the Blitzball World Championship that blitzball teams compete on a yearly basis.</p>
        
        <p>Before the tourament, Tidus and company meet the religion leaders of the religion of Yevon. One of their leaders is Seymour. As an antagonist, his goals and objectives to become a leader of Yevon by murdering his father, have a relationship with Yuna to gain her summoner powers, and to become the next Sin to destory the world of Spira. Another thing to mention about the protagonists' vist to Luca is that Auron returns to the story as the mentor character to the two main protagonists because it is revealed that he was the third member of Tidus's and Yuna's fathers team. Between qualifying for the blitzball tourament and before the semifinals of the blitzball tourament, the opponent blitzball team kidnaps Yuna in hopes that Wakka's and Tidus's Besaid Aurochs would forfeit the semifinals. Tidus and company find and save Yuna while Wakka and his team competes against their opponent without Tidus.</p>
        
        <p>Reaching the finals, Tidus, Wakka, and the Besaid Aurochs finish off the blitzball tourament as champions of it. Afterwards, the protagonists and the future antagonist of the main story work together to get rid of the monsters that took over the arena after the blitzball tourament was over. Auron and Tidus have a reunion and it is revealed that Jecht is Sin. Tidus denies Auron's revelation and the two of them reunite with Yuna. Yuna encourages the discouage Tidus by telling him the plan to achieve the last aeon lies in wait at the ruins of Tidus's hometown. Traveling to their next location within the country, the group follows the Mi'hen Highroad to a Crusader operation. The Crusader operation is trap and destroy Sin through the usage of heavy machinery. The operation fails and the Crusaders suffer casualities as a result.</p>
        
        <p>Afterwards, Auron reminds Tidus of what he told him earlier and that Sin would follow him wherever he goes as long as the both of them are still alive. With Sin, comes the casualities of it. The protagonists cover a river by way of a gigantic elephant. Yuna is kidnapped and saved by Tidus again during the trip to their next destination. On the shore of their next destination called Moonflow, Tidus reunites with Rikku and she joins the group of supporting protagonists within the main story. The next part of the destination is Seymour's hometown called Guadosalem. Seymour shows Tidus's hometown to the rest of the protagonists through a visual recording within a spheral device. He offers the group a history lesson about how the first Sin was destroyed through a married couple. He proposes to Yuna for the greater good and she requests time to think about it.</p>
        
        <p>The group of protagonists end their time in the enemy's strongholds by visiting the graves of their descended love ones before returning to the pilgrimage. Before leaving, they discovered a spheral recording device that held the memories of Seymour's father within it. The next destination to their final destination was through a thundering desert called the Thundering Plains. They stop at a traveling agency to discover the messages within the spheral recording device. After Tidus and Yuna listen to Seymour's father's visual messages, Yuna accepts Seymour's proposal and goes to his religious temple located at Lake Macalania. Within the temple of Lake Macalania, the group discovers that Seymour murdered his father to gain the pastoral title of "Maestar" for the religion of Yevon (Tidus). Yuna was going to marry Seymour to get him arrested by the governing authorities of Spira. Seymour decided to attack the group for confronting him about his father's group and he is thought to be initially dead after the battle is over.</p>
        
        <p>After defeating Seymour, the group is labeled traitors of the religion of Yevon by Seymour's people. Nearly captured, the icy lake that the group is staying on breaks due to Sin's reappearance. Washed away by the icy waters, the group lands on another island called the Bikanel Island. This island is Rikku's homeland and the group realizes that Yuna is missing from the group during exploration down the stream and across the island. Once Riku's home is in sight, there is a siege that has occurred from Seymour's people to destroy Rikku's people known as the "Al Bhed" (Final Fantasy X). Tidus finds out the truth about Yuna's pilgrimage that once the last aeon is summon then Yuna would also die after summoning it. Tidus wants to save Yuna and looks for a solution outside of the pilgrimmage during the escape on the Al Bhed airship called the 'Farhrenheit' (Tidus). The group of protagonists meet Rikku's father and Yuna's uncle named Cid who takes them to Yuna's location in the city of Bevelle in the country of Spira.</p>
        
        <p>Within Bevelle, Yuna is forced to marry the resurrected Seymour. Tidus and company slide down the airship to the marriage ceremony at the Bevelle temple. They could not stop the marriage ceremony but it did provide Yuna the opportunity to escape. After receiving the temple's aeon, the group reunites with Yuna and is sent to Yevon court for "killing Seymour and siding with the Al Bhed, and named the traitors of Yevon" (Tidus). Although as the court trial progresses, it is revealed that the real traitors of the people of Spira are the religious leaders of Yevon that are resurrected people that want Sin to continue living by giving the people false hope that Sin could actually be defeated by summoners and aeons. Based upon the religion of Yevon, the group of protagonists are sent to prison to wait out their sentences.</p>
        
        <p>After finding out their sentences, the group of protagonists escape their sentences by using an underground waterway to escape the subordinates of Yevon. Seymour allows them to escape but tells the group about his ulimate plan which was revealed in his goals and objectives when he was first introduced. The protagonists escape to the woods of the Lake of Macalania and recover from the events that transpired. Their convictions of the pilgrimage was shaken, but their friendships with one another allow them to continue the pilgrimage journey. Tidus and company arrive to the Mountain of Gagazet which is Kamhri's hometown. Tidus meets the ghost boy that was following him and discovered that he, his father, and hometown were conceptually created by dreams of the ghost boy and made into existence by the aeons. In order for the ghost boy to rest and Tidus to stop existing, Sin will have to be destroyed forever. Tidus kept his existence from the other protagonists in his company and they continue with the pilgrimage.</p>
        
        <p>The heroes arrive in Zanarkand ruins. Within the ruins, they discover "Seymour's childhood and the last chapters of Braska's ["Yuna's father"] pilgrimage" (Tidus). It is the saddest part of the story that makes the audience feel sorry for the protagonists and the antagonist witnessed. When they reach the first summoner in Zanarkand, the pilgrimage of Yuna was offically complete. The heroes were trying "to come up with a plan to save Yuna", but they ran out of time and had to choose a protagonist to become the last aeon (Tidus). The heroes refuse to turn anyone into an aeon which resulted in a battle with the first summoner to change the fate of the world of Spira. They defeat the first summoner ending the fate death of the world of Spira and discover that one of their own is a resurrected person.</p>
        
        <p>With the old solution to defeat Sin gone, the heroes come up with a new solution to defeat Sin. The new solution became to "destroy the final Aeon, Yu Yevon will be left invulnerable, which is when the party can destroy him. To do this, they must invade the hulk of Sin's body and destroy Yu Yevon from inside" (Final Fantasy X). The heroes faced and defeated Seymour one last time within the body of Sin. The heroes travel the body further inside and discover Jecht and the final aeon inside the heart of the beast. The final aeon was defeated which killed Jecht in the process and allowed Yu Yevon to escape temporarily. The heroes defeat Yu Yevon by sacrificing all of Yuna's aeons along their journey. After sacrificing the last aeon, the heroes defeated Yu Yevon and the world of Spira was saved.</p>
        
        <p>The main story ends with Auron and Tidus disappearing from the world of Spira after saying their farewells to Yuna, Lulu, Rikku, Wakka, and Kimarhi. In the afterlife, Tidus and Auron are reunited with Braska (Yuna's father) and Jecht and they lived happily ever after. Until the sequel to the next game. First off, I apologize for not making my summary shorter but out of the four game reviews this game was definitely the longest. When it comes to the role-playing genre, the story does have a good narrative and there is a lot of character progress within both the protagonists and the main antagonists that still make the game enjoyable. Final Fantasy X needed to make their story smaller though and it gets some point reduction for it. However, overall Final Fantasy X deserves an A- for the main story.</p>
        
        <p>The second part of the review is the combat system. The combat system in the action role-playing genre is called a turn-based combat system. Eltimar of Unleashthegamer.com states that a turn-based video game is "a game in which a primary method of interacting with the world (usually combat) is turn-based"(Eltimar). From the first Final Fantasy game to the twelfth Final Fantasy game, the creators of the Final Fantasy series had all their games as turn-based. However, Final Fantasy XIII changed to a more open world role-playing game through an open-world combat system. In Final Fantasy X, the combat system had three characters that you could fight with. Both the heroes and enemies, each get one turn until one of the characters is knockout of commission.</p>
        
        <p>The leveling up system within the game contains different spheres and pathways for the characters' abilities and skills to connect to each other to have a tag team move set. This means that two characters can attack at once instead of each attacking individually. The combos and abilities that the characters had were basic combos, items, magic, summons, and advanced combos to choose from. Each character also specialized in certain attacks when it came to their advanced combos. The flaw of this turn-based system is both it and an action role-playing game problem, the video game has to grind in order to complete the video game and get all the abilities. This will turn off a lot video game completionists but newcomers and Final Fantasy fans can enjoy the game if they are patient with the level up process. For the combat system of Final Fantasy X, I will give it a B+. </p>
        
        <p>The successes and failures of the game will be brief. The game is successful when it comes to character development, the usage of the camera, the environments of the world of Spira, and especially the story. The voice acting was good for the most part with the main character being annoying from time to time. The visual graphics through various remeasters and remakes makes the game more modern for newcomers to the role-playing genre. The failures of Final Fantasy X comes down to the design of the character models graphically, having too many villains, and too many difficult minigames after the main story is completed. Overall, the final grade for Final Fantasy X is an A with a number grade of a 92.</p>
