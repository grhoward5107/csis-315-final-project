        <p>For a disclamer, this review is not about the movie of The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Rather, it is about the video game based off this particular movie. If you are searching for a movie review then I would suggesting searching else where. However, if you are looking for the video game of the same title then you have come to the right place.</p>
        
        <p>When it comes to playing The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, my initial reaction was both of bewilderment and excitement for a video game that was transformed into one of my favorite Christian movies of all time. Although this video game is not perfect, it is a good video game from the early 2000s and presents a challenge for first time video gamers who have never played it before. To critique the video game in depth, the video gamer needs to know about the main story, about the combat that the video game presents, and the successes and failures that this video game has to offer to the role-playing action genre. To begin, let's discuss the story.</p>
        
        <p>The story of the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King starts out where the previous movie concluded. At the end of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the battle of Helm's Deep was in full motion. When the tide of the battle had turned, Mr. Tolkein sets the scene, "there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white, shining in the rising sun. Over the low hills the horns were sounding. Behind him, hastening down the long slopes were a thousand men on foot" (The Two Towers p.158). Based upon the illustration above, the rider clad in white was Gandalf with an army of a thousand men called the army of Rohan. After the movie cutscene of this event, Gandalf gets off this horse and the tutorial session begins with the player of the video game playing as Gandalf.</p>
        
        <p>The player of the video game goes through the entire tutorial in the battle of Helm's Deep learning how to navigate, attack, and defend himself against the armies of Sauron. Sauron is the main antagonist of the story from both the movie and the video game. Another thing to be noted is the protagonists of both the movie and the video game. The protagonists are the Fellowship of the Ring but only certain characters of the fellowship are playable. The rest of the characters are locked until the video gamer completes the entire game. The Fellowship of the Ring is Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippen, and Boromir.</p>
        
        <p>Boromir died in the first movie known as the Fellowship of the Ring. Merry and Pippen are bonus playable characters within this video game. With that being said, the other six members of the fellowship group are main playable characters within the main story. After the tutorial level is over, the story is divided into three different paths. The three paths called the path of the wizard, the path of the king, and the path of the hobbits. The path of the wizard follows Gandalf's story from the journey to Isengard to the final battle of Mondor. The path of the King follows Aragorn's story along with his companions of Legolas and Gimli from the paths of the dead to the final battle of Mondor where the path of the wizard intersects with the path of the king. The path of the Hobbits follows Sam's and Frodo's story from escape the city of Osgiliath to the destroying of the One Ring at Mount Doom.</p>
        
        <p>Within each story, Gandalf's journey was about gathering allied armies for the final battle by helping each ally fight Sauron's forces. Aragorn's journey was about a king's destiny by holding allegiances together and conquering the territories of Gondor from Sauron's forces in route to the final battle of Mondor. Frodo's journey was about destroying the One Ring that the main plot revolved around so that Sauron and his forces of evil could never take physical form in the world of the living again. The execution of all the stories were consistent with the source material of the movies directed by Peter Jackson and the books written by J.R.R. Tolkien. For the main story, the video game deserves an A+. The second part of the discussion is video game combat system.</p>
        
        <p>The combat system of The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King has a good set of combos but lacks variety and gets repetitive really fast. Although the video gamer is able to upgrade his abilities through a leveling up system within the game. The basic combos to get the abilities for leveling up are single button combos that only get better the more abilities that the video gamer unlocks within the game. Each of the main characters get one main medieval weapon and one projectile weapon. Gandalf uses his staff and a sword, Aragorn uses a bow and arrow and an elvish sword, Legolas's weapons are similar to Aragorn except with an extra sword, and Gimli gets a dwarf ax. Whereas Frodo and Sam get swords and daggers to fight Sauron's armies with. </p>
        
        <p>Each button on the video game console control has a special purpose for the main characters to either attack or defend themselves against Sauron's armies. However, video gamers who do not like the Lord of the Rings trilogy will not return to the game based solely on combat system. To get the correct abilities for each time that the video gamer levels up, he or she needs to know ahead of time which abilities are the best to complete game. Otherwise, the video gamer will have to go through the classical role-playing level up system by playing the game repeatedly to get all the leveling up points to get the specific ability needed to defeat Sauron's forces within each level. For the combat system, the video game deserves a B-. Next up, the successes and failures of the video game.</p>
        
        <p>The failures of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King comes from the aging of the video game. The video game graphics have a lot of dark colors and not a lot of complementary or light colors for the video gamer to tell the difference between an ally, an enemy, or a shadow. It is through these video game graphics and lighting alone that Electronic Arts needs to remake this video game for future generations to enjoy. Along with the video game graphics, the character models look obselete. After a cutscene, the character's model face looks smashed in and the eyes and mouth are not visible enough graphically for the video gamer to know what their character is feeling about a certain situation within the game. The final failure of this video game is the usage of camera angles in level design. Instead of the camera following the character's perspective, the camera follows the level design's environment and does not allow the video gamer to find the place that he or she is suppose to navigate to. This is a problem of older Sony Playstation 2 console video games that can be fixed through a remake.</p>
        
        <p>The successes of the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King comes from the source material and the difficulty in completing each level within the video game. As a kid, I had a lot of difficult completing the entirety of the game because the bosses within the game were so difficult to defeat even in standard mode. It would normally take me weeks to complete a level within the game because the strategies to defeat the bosses were not always available online so I had to solve them myself which gives the video gamers satisfaction in knowing that he or she is one of the few people that defeated that particular boss within the game. Another thing that I appreciate about this game is the usage of movie cutscenes, the soundtrack, and the voice acting. The movie cutscenes came from the final movie of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It also provided subtitles and narration from the voice actor of Gandalf so that the video gamer knew what each character was doing within each movie cutscene. The voice acting was amazing because the video game used all the voice actors of the movie to do the video game characters' voices. The soundtrack also followed the movie which was a welcoming surprise to both followers of the Lord of the Ring trilogy and newcomers alike. Overall, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King deserves a B- which is an overall grade of an 83.</p>
