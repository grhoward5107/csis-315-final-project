        <h1>Kingdom Hearts Arrives on Xbox</h1>
        
        <p>From 2002 to 2018, the main story of Kingdom Hearts has only been playable on Sony Playstation consoles. However, in 2019, the main story of the Kingdom Hearts series choose to appear on multiple video gaming consoles instead of just one. When the first video game of the Kingdom Hearts series was released in 2002, it originally released only on the PlayStation 2. However, since that time, there have been twelve other video games that have appeared on different video game consoles beginning with the second video game released about two years later.</p>
        
        <p>Before continuing the discussion further, the readers need to know what Kingdom Hearts is, how it got on different video gaming consoles, and how it can affect the development of the action role-playing game's series. Kingdom Hearts is known as an iconic video game franchise of the action role-playing genre. Its original premise is about a boy named Sora who travels to many different Disney worlds to find his friends and defeat his main antagonist known as the Heartless. The Disney worlds are different Disney movies that play out just like the movie does but with a video game twist that includes the main character and his supporting characters into the story.</p>
        
        <p>Along with Sora, Donald Duck and Goofy of the classic Disney movies travel with him to different Disney worlds to find their friend, Mickey, while also searching for his friends. The story begins with Sora having an ordinary life on his home world wanting to explore other worlds outside of his own. In order to do this, he needs to built a transportation vehicle with his home world friends called Riku and Kairi. When the transportation vehicle is finished, they want to leave their home world the next day, but the Heartless has other plans for the trio. </p>
        
        <p>The Heartless invade Sora's home world and separate him from each of his friends one by one. After his world disappears, he is left in a different world with a gigantic key known as the Keyblade. The Keyblade can be used either as a sword to defeat the Heartless or to lock away the darkness of different Disney world's hearts by locking the key hole of the door to each Disney world. The protagonists of each Disney movie help Sora fulfill his goals and objectives while the antagonists of each Disney movie harm Sora and keep his friends away from him for their dark desires and motivations.</p>
        
        <p>Now that we covered the basics of Kingdom Hearts, let's discuss the different video game consoles that it has been on. After the first video game was released, Kingdom Hearts has been on a variety of video game consoles. When discussing the different video game consoles that the newest installment of the franchise will be on, Daniel Van Boom and Jackson Ryan of cnet.com explain that "while Kingdom Hearts has found its way to most major consoles including Nintendo's handhelds, [Kingdom Hearts] 3 will be the first game to be on a Microsoft console" (Boom, D. V., & Ryan, J. (n.d.)). This means that every new main story entry added to the action role-playing franchise will be placed on both the futuristic Sony PlayStation consoles and the futuristic Microsoft Xbox consoles. </p>
        
        <p>The only question left to answer is how Kingdom Hearts games on Microsoft Xbox consoles could affect the development of future games moving forward. Based upon Kingdom Hearts 3's development, Alexa Ray Corriea of Polygon.com states that "Kingdom Hearts 3 director Tetsuya Nomura said that the development on the game had been switched to Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4" (Corriea, A. R. (2014, October 7)). This was one of the problems that the game director had for developing Kingdom Hearts 3 that delayed the video game's release date on both Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox consoles. As the article progresses, another reason for the switch to a different game engine is "'due to the impact of changing the game engine to Unreal Engine 4, which we did for various reasons, there is some difficulty rendering images', Nomura said" (Corriea, A. R. (2014, October 7)). The difficulties of rendering images within video games appears to have come from the graphics inside of it and the different video gaming consoles that run them digitally. Only time will tell if this video gaming engine's durability will last longer than the last one did but if future Kingdom Hearts games continue to be developed then there is a possibility of it appearing on other video game consoles. </p>
