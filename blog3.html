       <h1>Final Fantasy VII: Remake Vs. Original</h1>
        
        <p>When it comes to a video game, video gamers will ask if it meets or exceeds expectations. If it meets expectations then both the original video game and the remake video game will be compared and contrasted for generations to come. If it exceeds expectations then the original video game is normally forgotten in favor of its modern counterpart.</p>
        
        <p>To evaluate these scenarios more throughly, the reader needs a classical video game that is currently being remade. This video game is Final Fantasy VII. Final Fantasy VII is known both in the video game industry and the action role-playing genre as one of the greatest video games of all time. According to multiple game media outlets, the game is scheduled to release next year. So then, this video game fits the criterion.</p>
        
        <p>The author believes that the remake will exceed the expectations of the original video game. The reason that this remake video game will be successful is because it honors the original video game's source material by returning the original staff that created the video game in the first place. The video game industry responsible for creating and remaking this video game is Square Enix, Inc. Originally known as Squaresoft, Square Enix Inc. "develops, publishes, distributes, and licenses SQUARE ENIX&reg;, EIDOS&reg;, and TIATO&reg; branded entertainment content throughout the Americas as part of the Square Enix group of companies. Square Enix Inc., is affliciated with a global network of leading development studios such as Crystal Dynamics&reg; and Eidos Montreal&trade;" (About Square Enix Inc.). Based upon the resources and success that Square Enix Inc. has had over the years, it is a safer bet that this remake will become a success more than a failure.</p>
        
        <p>The main story of Final Fantasy VII follows a mercanary named Cloud Stife. As a mercanary, Cloud is "hired by the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE--led by Barret Wallace--to help fight the mega-corporation Shinra Electric Power Company, who attempts to drain the planet's lifeblood as an energy source to further their profits. Cloud joins forces with many others to save the planet, which is threatened by Shinra and Cloud's nemesis Sephiroth, and discovers a reason to fight for a cause other than his own" (Final Fantasy VII). Although the premise of the video game is simple to understand, there is a lot of depth and character that goes into the creation of the main story and the growth of the main character.</p>
        
        <p>Like most remakes, Final Fantasy VII remake will have changes within it that were not part of the original video game. The first massive change that Square Enix has done is "recreated the 1997 classic from the ground-up, with brand-new visuals and a completely different style of gameplay" (Webb, K., 2019). This means that the story will be tweaked to meet video gamers' expectations but also that the visuals and gameplay will be modernized for them as well. The video game "will be released in an episodic format, meaning players won't be able to experience the full story of the original when the first episode  drops on March 3, 2020" (Webb, K., 2019). In other words, the remake of the video game is massive in size that it could not fit on a single disk. The final observation that the remake changes from the original video game is the combat "in the remake isn't turn-based. You'll be able to run around and attack freely" (Webb, K., 2019). In the action role-playing genre, the turn-based role-playing games are becoming obsolete as the open-world environments and free style action combat have modernized the action role-playing genre to fit the needs of the video game consumers. Overall, this game is shaping up to replace the original Final Fantasy VII and its time to put that Playstation One formatted game to rest.</p>
