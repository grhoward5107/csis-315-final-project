        <p>Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm is a video based upon a Shonen Jump manga and anime series of Naruto. When playing Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm, my initial reaction was satisfactory but not of any excitement due to the lack of faithfulness to the source material. However, the video game is fun for video gamers that are not Naruto fans because it combines the two genres of action-role playing and fighting together.</p>
        
        <p>To explore what this video game has to offer, you and I will recap the story that the video game was based on, review the video game's mechanisms such as the combat system, and find out the video game's flaws and successes. This particular game was well made when it came to the basics of a fighting genre game but it failed when it came to the basics of a role-playing genre game. The main story of the video game is centered around Naruto. Naruto is a ninja within the village of the Hidden Leaves within the Land of Fire. The Land of Fire is a country kind of like the United States except there is only one city within it. The main plot of Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm centers around Naruto's burden of carrying a fox spirit within him known as the Nine Tails fox, earning the respect of his village and his teammates through various acts of heroism, and learning how to become a great ninja so that he can become the village leader known as the Hokage.</p>
        
        <p>The main story begins with Naruto just  graduating from the Ninja Academy and eating ramen at a ramen shop with his previous mentor that he calles Iruka Sensei. After his meal, Naruto goes through the basics of ninja training such as learning how to fight, teamwork, and climbing trees vertically and horizontally for charka control and minigames within the game. After the basics of a ninja of covered, the story picks up with the chunin exams. Naruto and his team are compromised of three genin and one jonin. Genin are freshman ninja students and jonin are teachers of the upperclass and underclass ninjas. Naruto's other two teammates are a guy named Sasuke and a girl named Sakura. Their teacher is named Kakashi and he is the one that assigns them various missions to get each of them ready for the chunin exams.</p>
        
        <p>The chunin exams are graduation exams to become sophomore ninjas and to get more privileges within the ninja system of the village such as leading your own squads without a jonin present. As Naruto's team goes through the chunin exams, they meet one of the antagonists of the video game named Orochimaru. Orochimaru is a snake human hybrid that seeks to destroy the Hidden Leaf Village and achieve immorality. He is the main antagonist of the video game but he has his own subordinates and a rival group that seeks out Naruto's powers known as the Akatsuki. Back to the main story, after fighting Orochimaru and having him escape, Naruto and his teammates arrive at a location to versus their peers one-on-one. If they win the battle then they move onto the final exam. However, if they lose then they are disqualified from the chunin exams.</p>
        
        <p>The main story progresses through these battles until the Leaf Village is attack from another village known as the Hidden Sand Village from the Land of Wind. Naruto and his teammates pursue the genin that came from that particular village because Sasuke and another genin's battle was interrupted by the attack that was in progress. After the teams of genin clashed, the battle resulted in a stalemate with the two parties and villages calling a truce because both sides were manipulated by the main antagonist of the video game. However, before the truce, Orochimaru killed the Hokage of the village so Naruto and his new teacher need to find a new Hokage to protect the village.</p>
        
        <p>In the meanwhile, the Akatsuki sent two members of their organization to go after Naruto. One of them is an incredibly strong ninja with a strong and the other is an extraordinary ninja who is the older brother of Naruto's teammate, Sasuke. Sasuke hates his older brother, named Itachi, because he killed his parents and his entire extended family known as the Uchiha clan. When Naruto finds the new Hokage and trains to develop his new teacher's main technique, Itachi and his partner catch up to Naruto and Sasuke intervenes. Sasuke loses to Itachi and Itachi puts Sasuke is a ninja technique, called genjustu, so Sasuke can relive the death of his family again and again. Naruto's new teacher, named Jiraya, intervenes saving Naruto and the comatose Sasuke from Itachi and his partner. The new Hokage does not want the new position of Hokage because of the persuasion from Orochimaru but changes her mind after discovering that Naruto's dream is similar to people in the past that inspired her to become the great ninja that she currently is. </p>
        
        <p>The new Hokage, named Tsunade, saves Sasuke and Kakashi from their comatoses after defeating Orochimaru and his subordinate with the help of Jiraya and Naruto. Now as the new Hokage, Tsunade heals people from life threatening injuries so that they can either continue their ninja careers or resume ordinary lives. Meanwhile, after Sasuke is healed, he wants to leave the Hidden Leaf Village in pursue of power from Orochimaru to defeat Itachi. Naruto and his teammates and teachers try to keep Sasuke in the village but fail. Naruto and four of his classmates go after Sasuke and defeat each of Orochimaru's subordinates but their mission fails because Naruto cannot defeat Sasuke to bring him back home. The story ends with Naruto and Jiraya discussing a three year training journey with Jiraya trying to persuade Naruto to give up on his former teammate. Naruto refuses to give up on Sasuke and Jiraya gives into Naruto's philosophy of saving Sasuke from his own personal darkness through training him into a more mature ninja.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, this story has a lot of story arcs which is why the review is so expansive. However, the flaws of the main story was its expansiveness and its forgetfulness of a beginning story arc that developed Naruto into the character that he is. Along the same lines, the main story took liberties to change some aspects of the story that did not happen in the original source material and missed Naruto's departure at the end of the story. Overall, the main story gets a C for taking shortcuts and cutting corners. The next aspect to analyze in the combat system of the video game.</p>
        
        <p>In short, the combat system of the video game was great in both basic combos and advanced combos. Through each fight, the video gamer is able to experience all the ninjutsu techniques of each character within the game whether the character fought another character one on one or within a group of characters that supported one character within a fight. The only problems with the battles within the game is the artificial intellgience within the opponents of the video game do not put up much resistance unless the difficult goes up several levels from the default difficult. The video game camera is also very slow compared to video games released this year and will need a patch for people to continue enjoying the game. Overall, the combat system was better than the story of the video game and deserves a B+.</p>
        
        <p>The successes and failures will be brief for this video game. Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm suceeded in bringing the manga story of Naruto to life through the visual graphics and the soundtrack of it. The visuals match the animation style of the original anime and the character models are spot on. Unfortunately, the failures are too much to overcome outside of the main story and combat system. The voice acting was bad. Naruto's voice actor is extremely annoying by introducing each level in a high pitch voice. Along with this, the voice actor's words do not sync well with what the animated character is trying to say with a delay between each sentence that is spoken. As a Naruto fan, it is a disappointment to me because I enjoy the original anime and manga of Naruto but the voice acting is unforgiveable in this game. Overall, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm gets a C with an overall grade of a 75.</p>
