        <p> What is a role-playing game? According to Dictionary.com, a role-playing game is "a game which participants adopt the roles of imaginary characters in an adventure under the direction of a Game Master" (role-playing game). Based upon this description, the video gamer guides an imaginary character through an adventure within an imaginary world. Within this particular genre, the main character is normally an ordinary person within an imaginary world until a catastrophe occurs. Once the catastrophe occurs, the main character's world is either completely changed or does not exist anymore for the character to return too. In order for the main character's life to return back to the way things were before the catastrophe, he or she will have to go on an adventure to discover what or who was responsible for the catastrophe that started this particular character's journey.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout the adventure, the main character changes from an ordinary person to the protagonist of the story. The way that the change happens for the main character is through him or her facing many obstacles and challenges that teaches him or her about the supporting characters' perspective and or the antagonist's perspective. The antagonist is the villain of the story that originated the catastrophe within the imaginary world. Once the protagonist knows the antagonist's perspective and fulfills his or her own goals and/or objectives by defeating the anatagonist and saving the supporting characters, then he or she returns to their ordinary lives or adapt to their worldly circumstances based upon the changes that happened to their saved imaginary world. If the main conflict is still not resolved through the first installment of the franchise then the story continues through various sequels which then results in a trilogy of games. 
            
        <p>The various sequels can continue solving the main character's catastrophe or it can create spin-off games that happen before or after the catastrophe with the supporting character(s) being the main character while the main character of the main story is either not born yet or is not the main focus of the game. The best way of thinking of an role-playing game (or RPG for short) is the theatrical plot of the hero's journey. Examples of the hero's journey in theatrical films are the first three films of the Star Wars franchise and the Wizard of Oz film. </p>
